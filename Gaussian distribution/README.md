## What is Gaussian distribution?

In statistics, a normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.

## The experiment

If we flip a coin 100 times and count the number of 'Head' appearances, at the end we get the proportion of heads as a percentage.

if we do this experiment a large number of times(100,000), and recorde the proportion of heads for each expirement, and create a bar chart where the X-Axis is the proportions we got(non-repetitive) and the Y-Axis is the number of occurences for the proportions. we get a bell shaped curve which represents a Gaussian distribution.

Notice that the calculated mean for the proportion values for all expirements is very close to 0.5 (which is 50%), that is for 50% heads and 50% tails. 
## My approach

I did the expirement in 2 ways, the first one (normal) is as explained above, in the second one I used a probability density function (pdf).
